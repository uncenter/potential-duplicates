```yaml

  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: wow-actions/potential-duplicates@v1
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Issue title filter work with anymatch https://www.npmjs.com/package/anymatch.
          # Any matched issue will stop detection immediately.
          # You can specify multi filters in each line.
          filter: ''
          # Exclude keywords in title before detecting.
          exclude: ''
          # Label to set, when potential duplicates are detected.
          label: potential-duplicate
          # Get issues with state to compare. Supported state: 'all', 'closed', 'open'.
          state: all
          # If similarity is higher than this threshold([0,1]), issue will be marked as duplicate.
          threshold: 0.6
          # Reactions to be add to comment when potential duplicates are detected.
          # Available reactions: "-1", "+1", "confused", "laugh", "heart", "hooray", "rocket", "eyes"
          reactions: 'eyes, confused'
          # Comment to post when potential duplicates are detected.
